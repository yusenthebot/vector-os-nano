"""Level 29: Pre-explore navigation debug harness — P2 (FAR routing before explore).

Root cause: FAR planner silently rejects /goal_point when is_graph_init_=false.
The proxy publishes direct /way_point to localPlanner as fallback, but localPlanner
follows a straight line to the target — through walls.

The dead-reckoning mode (Mode 2) in NavigateSkill already routes through doorways
correctly, but Mode 0 (proxy) is tried first and times out after 45s without
detecting that FAR has no graph.

These tests verify:
  - Direct /way_point without FAR graph crosses walls (bug reproduction)
  - Dead-reckoning mode routes through doors correctly
  - Proxy should detect FAR unavailability and fall back faster
  - Navigate skill mode selection logic
