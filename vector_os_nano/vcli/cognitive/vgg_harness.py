"""VGG Harness — feedback loop wrapper around the VGG pipeline.

Three layers of retry/recovery:

Layer 1 (step-level): Strategy A fails → try alternative strategies
Layer 2 (tree-level): Step fails → re-decompose remaining goals with failure context
Layer 3 (pipeline-level): Whole tree fails → full re-plan with history

This prevents single-point failures from killing the entire task.
